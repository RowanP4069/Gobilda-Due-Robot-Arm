# Gobilda-Due-Robot-Arm
An Arduino Due sketch to control an RRRRR robot arm constructed from GoBilda build system components. The servos are controlled by an Adafruit PCA9685 I2C PWM  controller.

See the dev branch for updates, I only plan to merge into the main branch when I have something useful and stable.
